	<h2>Humans Need Not Apply Review</h2>
	<h3>By Gabriel Aquino</h3>
	<img src="https://pi.tedcdn.com/r/talkstar-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/production/playlists/playlist_642/2437dd5f-4efd-40e9-a417-8c9d879ac9ea/What-happens-after-robots-take-our-jobs_1200x627+(1).jpg?quality=89&w=800">
	<p>The video explains that because humans build robots to do more and more, people will lose jobs. Robots, unlike humans, don't tire and have the ability to do things perfectly. As time advances, robots will become cheaper and more business will invest in these machines as cost-efficient workers.</p>
	<p>Personally I believe that the video is correct in some points like the advancement of technology can take away jobs. However, as newer technology is being created, legal factors can control slow the reign of robots.</p>

		<h3>Straight to the point I see?</h3>
		<h4>Tsering Dhondup</h4>
		<p>I certainly hope that legal action can stop the reign of terror coming from robots, but uhhh, I really wouldn't be too sure at this point... I like the gray/grey background for the website, gives it a nice touch considering the subject is about robots and how they'll take over the future. Um, what else? Well, the blog entry was a bit short, maybe you could've given some more insight on how you felt about this robotic "uprising" of sorts. Give people your 100% opinion(without it being offensive, of course). Other than that, what you said was correct. Font was too generic in my opinion, go for some more "flavor" in your website, if that makes any sense. Make it look more appealing, the background was perfect so the font was the only thing that kind of dragged it down. Great photo, I can see the... passion, I guess? Simple, yet straight to the point, that is the best way for me to describe your website, and more specifically, this blog post. Nice work. </p>

	<h2>Blown to Bits Review</h2>
	<h3>Book Authors: Hal Abelson, Ken Ledeen, Harry Lewis</h3>
	<img src="http://smarterware.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/technology1.jpg">
	<p>"The Parking Garage Knows More than you Think" revolves on the "behind-the-scenes" technology. These are machines that work but isn't pubically announced. For example, some parking garages have visual detectors that match your lisence plate number with your ticket number. This is so people can't rob cars and pay their correct meter time. </p>
	<p>"Connect the Dots" is about how different technologies can gather different amounts of information, usually meaningless, but when put together, can be the difference between freedom or jail time.</p>
	<p>"Saving Time" focuses on the main reason why technology is so popular: it's a shortcut. Microwaves, cars, phones, etc. are all shortcuts for the goal we want to achieve.</p>

		<h3>Shocked</h3>
		<h4>Araina</h4>
		<p>wow I had no clue parking garages did that much. Facinating. You should go more in depth with the "Connect The Dots" it seems interesting.</p>

	<p><span class="monica">Monica</span>: Everything obviously got more advanced, phones got smaller and smarter and stuff like that.</p>

	<p class="mine">Gabriel: What is your greatest hope for future technology?</p>
	<p><span class="monica">Monica</span>: That it's like the movies, flying cars and sh*t.</p>
	<p class="mine">Gabriel: How about your greatest fear?</p>
	<p><span class="monica">Monica</span>: Powerful technology falling into the wrong hands.</p>
	<p class="mine">Gabriel: Do you have advice for the younger generations?</p>
	<p><span class="monica">Monica</span>: Um, enjoy it but don't depend on it.</p>
	<p class="mine">Gabriel: Do you think your job is vulnerable to technology?</p>

		<p> Technology seems as if it positively impacted your cousin. It seemed to help them and make life easier. With technology advancing the fear of being replaced is prominant and is understandable how monica feels.üëçüëè</p>
