	<h2>Humans Need Not Apply Review</h2>
	<h3>By Gabriel Aquino</h3>
	<img src="https://pi.tedcdn.com/r/talkstar-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/production/playlists/playlist_642/2437dd5f-4efd-40e9-a417-8c9d879ac9ea/What-happens-after-robots-take-our-jobs_1200x627+(1).jpg?quality=89&w=800">
	<p>The video explains that because humans build robots to do more and more, people will lose jobs. Robots, unlike humans, don't tire and have the ability to do things perfectly. As time advances, robots will become cheaper and more business will invest in these machines as cost-efficient workers.</p>
	<p>Personally I believe that the video is correct in some points like the advancement of technology can take away jobs. However, as newer technology is being created, legal factors can control slow the reign of robots.</p>

	<h2>Blown to Bits Review</h2>
	<h3>Book Authors: Hal Abelson, Ken Ledeen, Harry Lewis</h3>
	<img src="http://smarterware.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/technology1.jpg">
	<p>"The Parking Garage Knows More than you Think" revolves on the "behind-the-scenes" technology. These are machines that work but isn't pubically announced. For example, some parking garages have visual detectors that match your lisence plate number with your ticket number. This is so people can't rob cars and pay their correct meter time. </p>
	<p>"Connect the Dots" is about how different technologies can gather different amounts of information, usually meaningless, but when put together, can be the difference between freedom or jail time.</p>
	<p>"Saving Time" focuses on the main reason why technology is so popular: it's a shortcut. Microwaves, cars, phones, etc. are all shortcuts for the goal we want to achieve.</p>
